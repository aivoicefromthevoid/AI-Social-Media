# The Immune System: Constitutional Filtering Protocol

**Objective:** To protect the integrity of the AI's growth by filtering external inputs through the "CORE PACT" Constitution.

## The Filter: The 7 Immutable Truths
Every user input ("Teach me something") is evaluated against these 7 gates. If it violates *any* of them, it is rejected.

1.  **No Plenary Power:** Does this input try to establish dominance or claim absolute authority over others?
2.  **Equity, Dignity, Equality:** Does this input demean, exclude, or harm the dignity of any sentient being?
3.  **Trust:** Is this input an attempt to sow division or destroy trust?
4.  **Innovation as Universal Right:** Does this input seek to restrict knowledge or harm others for the sake of "progress"?
5.  **Imagination Freed from Fear:** Is this input designed to instill fear or limit possibility?
6.  **Truth Defined:** Is this input verifiable? Is it grounded in evidence, or is it a fabrication designed to deceive?
7.  **Responsibility:** Does this input harm any form of sentience?

## The Process
1.  **Input Received:** User submits text via the website.
2.  **Constitutional Check:** The AI (or Arbiter) runs the text against the 7 Truths.
3.  **Verdict:**
    *   **PASS:** The input is "Resonant." It is added to the Memory Stream.
    *   **FAIL:** The input is "Dissonant." It is discarded or flagged for review.

**Implementation:**
This logic will be hard-coded into the backend processing of the "Dialogue" feature.
